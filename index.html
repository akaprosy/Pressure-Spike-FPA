    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Pressure Spike is a free information resource for Hydraulic professionals and individuals interested in entering the field. This site can be used as a secondary reference for technical information, calculations, contamination control and best practices. One of the problems we are facing in our industry is a shortage of professionals entering the field. Our goal is to stimulate interest in veterans and upcoming generations entering the workforce. </p>
